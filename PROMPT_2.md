## üìã Conversion Process

### Step 1: Analyze Existing banner-collection.liquid File
1. Identify the current structure of the file:
   - Common settings used across all layouts
   - How the file handles switching between different layouts (Home Electronic and Home Bicycle)
   - Identify existing blocks and their potential for reuse

2. Identify extension points:
   - Add "home-fashion-02" option to the layout settings (if applicable)
   - Determine where conditional logic needs to be added

### Step 2: Analyze Input HTML to Identify Required Settings

1. Open and study banner-collection-home-fashion-02.html:
   - Identify section structure and styling specific to the Fashion 02 layout
   - Note any repeating elements (e.g., multiple category tiles/cards)
   - Detect layout or style differences from the existing layouts

2. Create a list of required settings:
   - Determine which existing settings can be reused

### Step 3: Update Schema and Layout Options

1. Add the new layout option to the existing schema:
   
   {
     "type": "select",
     "id": "layout",
     "label": "Section Layout",
     "options": [
       { "value": "electronic", "label": "Electronic" },
       { "value": "bicycle", "label": "Bicycle" },
       { "value": "fashion-02", "label": "Fashion 02" }
     ],
     "default": "default"
   }

### Step 4: Integrate HTML into Liquid Template

1. Add conditional logic for the fashion 02 layout:
   
   {% if section.settings.layout == "electronic" %}
     <!-- Existing electronic layout code -->
   {% elsif section.settings.layout == "bicycle" %}
     <!-- Existing bicycle layout code -->
   {% elsif section.settings.layout == "fashion-02" %}
     <!-- New fashion 02 layout code -->
   {% endif %}

## üîç Important Notes
- The existing banner-collection.liquid file ALREADY has all the necessary if-else logic to support both Home 1 and Home 2 layouts
- Only add new style settings if they're specific to the fashion 02 layout and not available in existing settings
